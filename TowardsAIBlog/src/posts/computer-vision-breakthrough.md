Computer vision has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past decade, evolving from traditional image processing techniques to sophisticated deep learning architectures that rival human visual perception. This evolution represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, enabling machines to understand and interpret visual information with unprecedented accuracy.

## The Foundation: Convolutional Neural Networks

The modern computer vision revolution began with the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which introduced several key innovations:

### Convolution Operations
CNNs use convolution operations to detect local features in images, preserving spatial relationships while reducing computational complexity.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ConvBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1):
        super(ConvBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)
        self.batch_norm = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.batch_norm(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=1000):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        
        # Feature extraction layers
        self.conv1 = ConvBlock(3, 64)
        self.conv2 = ConvBlock(64, 128)
        self.conv3 = ConvBlock(128, 256)
        self.conv4 = ConvBlock(256, 512)
        
        # Pooling layer
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        
        # Classification head
        self.adaptive_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((7, 7))
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(512 * 7 * 7, 4096),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(4096, 4096),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(4096, num_classes)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Feature extraction
        x = self.pool(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.pool(self.conv2(x))
        x = self.pool(self.conv3(x))
        x = self.pool(self.conv4(x))
        
        # Global pooling and classification
        x = self.adaptive_pool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.classifier(x)
        
        return x
```

## Landmark CNN Architectures

### AlexNet (2012)
The breakthrough that demonstrated deep learning's potential, achieving significant improvements on ImageNet classification.

### ResNet (2015)
Introduced residual connections, enabling training of much deeper networks and solving the vanishing gradient problem.

```python
class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, stride, 1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, 1, 1, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        # Shortcut connection
        self.shortcut = nn.Sequential()
        if stride != 1 or in_channels != out_channels:
            self.shortcut = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 1, stride, bias=False),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
            )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        identity = x
        
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        
        out += self.shortcut(identity)
        out = F.relu(out)
        
        return out
```

### EfficientNet (2019)
Optimized CNN architecture that achieves superior accuracy with fewer parameters through compound scaling.

## The Vision Transformer Revolution

In 2020, Vision Transformers (ViTs) challenged the CNN dominance by applying transformer architecture directly to image patches, achieving competitive results on image classification tasks.

### Core ViT Architecture

```python
class PatchEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, in_channels=3, embed_dim=768):
        super(PatchEmbedding, self).__init__()
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2
        
        self.projection = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, embed_dim, 
                                   kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (B, C, H, W)
        x = self.projection(x)  # (B, embed_dim, H//patch_size, W//patch_size)
        x = x.flatten(2)        # (B, embed_dim, num_patches)
        x = x.transpose(1, 2)   # (B, num_patches, embed_dim)
        return x

class VisionTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, num_classes=1000, 
                 embed_dim=768, depth=12, num_heads=12, mlp_ratio=4):
        super(VisionTransformer, self).__init__()
        
        # Patch embedding
        self.patch_embed = PatchEmbedding(img_size, patch_size, 3, embed_dim)
        num_patches = self.patch_embed.num_patches
        
        # Class token and position embedding
        self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 1, embed_dim))
        self.pos_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, num_patches + 1, embed_dim))
        
        # Transformer blocks
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
                d_model=embed_dim,
                nhead=num_heads,
                dim_feedforward=int(embed_dim * mlp_ratio),
                dropout=0.1
            ),
            num_layers=depth
        )
        
        # Classification head
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.head = nn.Linear(embed_dim, num_classes)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        B = x.shape[0]
        
        # Patch embedding
        x = self.patch_embed(x)  # (B, num_patches, embed_dim)
        
        # Add class token
        cls_token = self.cls_token.expand(B, -1, -1)
        x = torch.cat([cls_token, x], dim=1)
        
        # Add position embedding
        x = x + self.pos_embed
        
        # Apply transformer
        x = self.transformer(x)
        
        # Classification
        x = self.norm(x)
        cls_output = x[:, 0]  # Use class token
        return self.head(cls_output)
```

    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
                        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

val_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],

import torchvision.models as models

# Load pre-trained model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Freeze backbone parameters
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Replace classification head
num_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)

# Fine-tune only the classification head

## Conclusion

The evolution from traditional CNNs to Vision Transformers represents a fundamental shift in how we approach computer vision problems. While CNNs revolutionized the field by introducing spatial inductive biases and hierarchical feature learning, Vision Transformers have demonstrated that attention mechanisms can be equally effective for visual understanding tasks.

The future of computer vision lies in hybrid approaches that combine the best aspects of both architectures, creating more efficient, robust, and capable systems. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with artificial vision, these advances will unlock new applications across industries, from healthcare and transportation to entertainment and scientific research.

The journey from pixels to understanding continues, with each breakthrough bringing us closer to machines that can see and interpret the world with human-like sophistication.
