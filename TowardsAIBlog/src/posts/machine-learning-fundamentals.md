Machine learning has transformed from an academic curiosity to the driving force behind modern technology. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to solidify your understanding, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamental concepts that power today's AI systems.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Instead of following pre-written instructions, ML algorithms identify patterns in data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.

### The Three Pillars of Machine Learning

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example: Simple classification pipeline
def ml_pipeline(X, y):
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    return model, accuracy
