"Build a fully responsive, production-ready blog website called Towards AI, inspired by Towards Data Science, with a sleek, futuristic dark mode design. The site should feature a minimalist or glassmorphic user interface, smooth transitions, and excellent readability across all devices. Use modern fonts like Inter, IBM Plex Sans, or Space Grotesk. The project must be easily deployable on Netlify and include a secure admin panel powered by Netlify CMS for content management."
